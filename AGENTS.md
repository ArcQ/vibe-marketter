# Coding Conventions

* Use TypeScript with strict settings.
* Prefer functional React components.
* Keep styles in `globals.css` or component-level CSS modules.
* The project context:
  ðŸš€ ReplyRadar scans your curated X lists every 5 min, filters engagement-bait, and sends a twice-daily digest of fresh (<2 h) tweets matched to your interestsâ€”each with an AI-drafted openerâ€”so you can spark 50 high-value convos in just 30 min a week.

do not use twitter's official api, use twitterapi.io which i've included the docs to in docs/twitterapi-io/llms.txt
